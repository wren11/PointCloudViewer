Point Cloud Viewer with Sphere-like Points
Overview
This project is a 3D point cloud viewer implemented using C# and the Silk.NET library. It visualizes a set of 3D points, rendering them as sphere-like points in a window. The application supports basic camera controls, including rotation, panning, and zooming, to navigate through the point cloud.

Features
3D Point Cloud Visualization: Renders a set of 3D points as sphere-like points.
Camera Controls: Supports rotation, panning, and zooming using mouse interactions.
Octree Partitioning: Efficiently partitions the point cloud data using an octree structure for optimized rendering.
Shader-based Rendering: Utilizes vertex and fragment shaders for rendering points with a smooth circle effect.
